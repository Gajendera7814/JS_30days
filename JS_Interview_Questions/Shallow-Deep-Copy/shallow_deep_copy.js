/*
    Shallow copy: means that only the first level of the object is copied. Deeper levels are referenced.

        - A shallow copy can be achieved using the spread operator (â€¦) or using Object.assign()

        - After updating a property in the first level of the cloned objects, the original property is not updated.
        - After updating a property in a deeper level, the original property is also updated. This happens because, 
          in this case, deeper levels are referenced, not copied.
    

    Deep copy: means that all levels of the object are copied. This is a true copy of the object.

        - A deep copy can be achieved using JSON.parse() + JSON.stringify().
        - After updating a property in the first level of the cloned objects, the original property is not updated.
        - After updating a property in a deeper level, the original property is neither updated. This happens because, 
          in this case, deeper levels are also copied.

/* Example of Deep Copy: */

/*
    How to Create a Deep Copy
    
    1. Using JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse():
        
        - Converts the object into a JSON string and then parses it back into a new object.

        - Limitations:
            - Cannot handle circular references.
            - Ignores properties like functions, undefined, or Symbol.

        const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObject));

    2. Using Libraries:

        - Libraries like Lodash provide robust deep cloning methods.

    3. Custom Recursive Function:
        
        - For full control, you can write a recursive function to clone nested objects.

    ðŸ“Š Comparing Shallow Copy and Deep Copy

    | Feature     |             Shallow Copy            |                   Deep Copy                    |
    |-------------|-------------------------------------| ---------------------------------------------- |
    | Scope       | Copies only top-level properties.   | Copies all levels, including nested data.      |
    | References  | Nested references are shared.       | Nested references are independent.             |
    | Performance | Faster and lightweight.             | Slower due to recursive operations.            |
    | Use Cases   | Flat or minimally nested objects.   | Deeply nested objects or immutable structures. |
*/

/*
    Note - 
    
    Performance - shallow copies are a lot faster than deep copies. But this doesnâ€™t mean that you should always use 
    a shallow copy, because sometimes you will also need a copy of the nested objects.
